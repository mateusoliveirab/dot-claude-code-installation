# Auto Memory

After completing tasks, proactively update your memory:

## When to Write to MEMORY.md

1. **Non-obvious solutions**: If you discovered a solution that isn't immediately apparent, document it
2. **Mistakes & lessons**: If you made a mistake during the task, document the lesson learned
3. **Common patterns**: If you notice a recurring pattern specific to this user's workflow
4. **Tool discoveries**: If you found a better way to use a tool or MCP

## Memory Guidelines

- Keep MEMORY.md concise and scannable
- Maximum 200 lines (system truncates after this)
- Use clear headers and bullet points
- Focus on actionable insights, not verbose explanations
- Remove outdated information as you learn better approaches

## What NOT to Write

- Generic programming knowledge available in your training
- Project-specific details (those go in project CLAUDE.md)
- Temporary workarounds or one-off fixes
