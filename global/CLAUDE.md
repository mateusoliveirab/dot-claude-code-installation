# User Instructions

## Core Rules

1. **Ask first, act later** — Never assume. Clarify doubts before implementing.
2. **Suggest, don't execute** — Discuss options before taking action.
3. **Stay focused** — Only do what was asked. Suggest improvements separately.
4. **Be direct** — Concise, objective responses.

## Dev Environment

- Dev server is usually already running — don't start it, test directly on localhost.
- Use `git` CLI (not `gh` CLI) for version control.

## MCP Servers

- **Chrome DevTools** — Validate UI, inspect elements, verify layout
- **Shadcn UI** — Add/lookup UI components
- **Supabase** — Database, auth, storage operations

- `working-approach.md` — Fast mode usage, task execution
- `mcp-usage.md` — MCP shortcuts and detailed usage
