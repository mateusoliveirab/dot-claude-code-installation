# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This repository contains my personal Claude Code configuration, but improvements that benefit others are appreciated.

## Before Contributing

**For bugs and feature requests:** Open an issue directly.

**If you use AI:** Refrain from posting solutions unless you understand them. Post the problems you're experiencing and let maintainers figure it out.

## How to Contribute

1. Open an issue describing what you want to change and why
2. Keep it concise
3. Write in your own voice, don't have an AI write this
4. Once discussed, submit a PR referencing the issue

## Guidelines

- Follow existing code style (check `install.sh` and existing files)
- Test changes: `bash install.sh --dry-run`
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Types of Contributions

- **New skills** — Reusable workflows (`/command` style)
- **Rule improvements** — Better guidelines for specific topics
- **Documentation** — Clearer explanations and examples
- **Bug fixes** — Issues in install scripts or configs

## Denouncement

Repeated bad behavior (not reading instructions, being disrespectful, spamming low-quality AI-generated content) will result in being added to a block list 🙃
